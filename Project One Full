In this Project we made a Full Stack React and Java application that handles Employee Reimbursements at a generic company. Our front end was made with React with TypeScript and our back end was made on Java 8.

In this project we have two User roles: Employee and Manager

The Employee User Stories are as follows:

Register an account
Login to their account
Log out of their account
Able to update their profile information
View their employee home page
Create a Reimbursement Request
View all of their Pending Reimbursement Requests
View all of their Resolved Reimbursement Requests


The Manager User Stories are as follows:

Login to their account
Log out of their account
View the manager home page
Approve or Deny Pending Requests
View all pending requests
View all resolved requests
View requests of a specific employee
View all employees
There are Four Reimbursement Types an employee can make:

Lodging
Food
Travel
Other

We used PostgreSQL and dBeaver to set up our databases

We created a Java application that would send/request data from the database

We created a React application that would send HTTP requests to our Java application to retrieve the information from the database

Summary: The Expense Reimbursement System (ERS) will manage the process of reimbursing employees for expenses incurred while on company time. All employees in the company can login and submit requests for reimbursement and view their past tickets and pending requests. Finance managers can log in and view all reimbursement requests and past history for all employees in the company. Finance managers are authorized to approve and deny requests for expense reimbursement.
